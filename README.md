# COMP4037 CW2 ‚Äì Data Visualization

Hi! This is my coursework submission for COMP4037 (Research Methods).  
I used Python to create a radar chart showing the environmental impact of four different diet groups.

The data is from the Oxford University dataset provided in the assignment.  
My goal was to explore how different diets (vegan, vegetarian, fish and meat) affect several environmental indicators.

---------

#Tools used:
- Python (matplotlib for plotting)
- scikit-learn (MinMaxScaler to normalize the data)

---------

#Chart type:
- Radar Chart (Spider Chart)

---------
#Variables included:
- Greenhouse gas emissions  
- Land use  
- Water scarcity  
- Eutrophication potential  
- Biodiversity impact  
- Agricultural water use  
- Acidification potential

-----------
#File:
- `cw2_diet_impact_chart.py` ‚Äì This is the Python script I wrote to generate the chart.

I grouped the data by diet group, calculated the average for each variable, normalized them, and plotted them all on one chart to compare the results.
